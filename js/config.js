	Update the config according to your needs. Two songs are added by default to show how to use the configuration.
	Note: JavaScript arrays do not end with comma (,). That means, when ending an array, do not use a comma.
	Right format should be something like this:
	music: ["cqwmDWCRuCU", "9yplucq49zs"]
	And this should not work:
    music: ["cqwmDWCRuCU", "9yplucq49zs", ]

    TODO: the loading screen crashes when only one song is present in the array.
    Also, when you want to test out the config in your browser, these browsers do not work (atleast for me):
    - Opera GX
    Tested and working browsers
    - Google Chrome
    - Microsoft Edge
    - Mozilla Firefox
